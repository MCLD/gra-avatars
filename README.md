# Great Reading Adventure Avatars

This repository contains the files used to create the default avatar package for [The Greating Reading Adventure](https://github.com/mcld/greatreadingadventure) online reading program software.

The majority of the avatar artwork originated in [Glitch the Game](https://www.glitchthegame.com/public-domain-game-art/) and was used via their [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).

Additional items are added (usually to support the [Maricopa County Reads](https://maricopacountyreads.org/) summer reading program managed by the [Maricopa County Library District](https://mcldaz.org/) who manages this package and The Great Reading Adventure software.)

## Usage

When using a release of The Great Reading Adventure, importing the default avatars in Mission Control will import the avatars from this collection.

## License

Much like the original art from Glitch the Game, art in this repository is licensed under the [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal License](https://github.com/MCLD/gra-avatars/blob/main/LICENSE).
